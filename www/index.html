                    have the information, it comes from The Billboard Book of 
                    Number One Hits by Fred Bronson. If Bronson does not have

            <details class="dict-item">
                <summary>Happiness</summary>
                <p>Happiness measure from 0 to 100 provided by Spotify. Spotify 
                    quantifies "happiness" using a valence score, which is calculated
                    by analyzing various audio features such as tempo, key, and energy.
                    A model is trained with songs that exhibit these features that 
                    calculates a happiness score. 
                </p>
            </details>

            <details class="dict-item">
                <summary>Danceability</summary>
                <p>Danceability measure from 0 to 100 provided by Spotify. 
                    Very similar to how happiness is calculated, Spotify uses
                    machine learning to analyze acoustic features of a song such
                    as tempo, beat strength, and rhythm stability.
                </p>
            </details>

            <details class="dict-item">
                <summary>Time</summary>
                <p>Date included is the first week the song hit number one in the
                    Billboard 100 list.
