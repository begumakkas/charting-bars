# Charting Bars

Begum Akkas

## Goal

My visual changed substantially since my proposal. I was planning on creating a bar
chart with supplementary visuals. Instead, I chose to represent the songs as dots. The goal of my visual did not change significantly. I wanted to show the gender divide for songwriters. After visualizing gender and race divides, my visualization felt insufficient so I added a song "happiness" view. Users are able to view the songs on a scale from least to most happy. I am also considering adding at least one more view, "danceability". 

## Data Challenges

As I explored my data further, I realized I had a lot fewer data points than I initally
realized. My initial mock up was not going to work so I changed my visual. Otherwise, I did not have any significant data challenges. 

## Walk Through

If you click the "Happiness" button, all songs will sort from less happy to more happy. This is not an extremely precise sorting, but is generally accurate on the scale. When you hover over the dots, you can see information about the song such as the artist, songwriter, song name, etc. 

## Questions

1. Is my current level of interaction sufficient?
